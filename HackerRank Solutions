An array is a series of elements of the same type placed in contiguous memory locations that can be individually referenced by adding an index to a unique identifier.

You'll be given an array of NN integers, and you have to print the integers in reverse order.

Note: If you have already solved the problem "Arrays Introduction" in the Introduction chapter of the C++ domain, you may skip this challenge.

Input Format

The first line of input contains NN, the number of integers. The next line contains NN integers separated by a space.

Constraints

1<=N<=10001<=N<=1000
1<=Ai<=100001<=Ai<=10000, where AiAi is the ithith integer in the array.

Output Format

Print the NN integers of the array in the reverse order on a single line separated by single spaces.


#include <math.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <assert.h>
#include <limits.h>
#include <stdbool.h>

int main(){
    int n; 
    scanf("%d",&n);
    int *arr = malloc(sizeof(int) * n);
    for(int i = 0; i < n; i++){
       scanf("%d",&arr[i]);
    }
    for(int j = n-1;j >= 0;j--){
        printf("%d",arr[j]);
        printf(" ");
    }
    return 0;
}
